## Overview

The **Separate Code** is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline your coding workflow by simplifying the process of extracting and editing code portions. It provides a dedicated, synchronized tab where you can effortlessly work on extracted code segments, all while maintaining real-time synchronization with their original sources. This extension is ideal for code manipulation, refactoring, and enhancing your overall coding efficiency.

⚠️ DO NOT UPDATE THE SOURCE CODE WHILE YOU HAVE THE NEW TAB OPEN, AS IT WILL OVERWRITE THE SOURCE CODE ON EVERY CHANGE YOU DO IN THE NEW TAB. ⚠️

## Features

- **Effortless Code Extraction**: Select and extract code sections from your source code effortlessly with a single click.
- **Synchronized Editing**: Experience real-time synchronization between the extracted code and its original source. Any changes made in the extracted code tab are immediately reflected in the source file.
- **Enhanced Refactoring**: Easily refactor your code by extracting methods, functions, or classes into separate tabs for focused editing.
- **Improved Code Management**: Keep your code organized by isolating and working on specific code segments.

## Getting Started

1. Install the **Separate Code** extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Open your desired project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Select the code portion you want to extract.
4. Right-click and choose "Separate Code" from the context menu, or use the predefined keyboard shortcut.
5. A synchronized tab will open with the extracted code. Make your edits, and they will instantly reflect in the source file.
